# moss-submitter-webapp

A simple webapp that submits zip archives to MOSS for plagiarism checking.

Use stack to build it: `stack build`.

It runs on yesod, so you can run a dev server like so: `stack exec -- yesod devel`.

Set the environment variable `$MOSSUserID` to your Moss user id before you run the program.
